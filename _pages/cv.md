# Experience
### **Graduate Research Assistant** | Michigan State University | East Lansing, MI | Aug 2019 - Apr 2024
Quinn Lab - *Departments of Microbiology, Genetics, & Immunology and Biochemistry & Molecular Biology* <br>
My primary research project focused on determining mechanisms behind bile acid conjugation by intestinal microorganisms and investigated consequences of this aspect of microbial bile acid metabolism on the host.
* Data steward to a 1,400 sample mother-infant cohort, with paired microbiome and metabolome datasets.
* Performed enzyme kinetic experiments to characterize bile acid conjugation by bile salt hydrolase.
* Analyzed and identified key changes in the metabolome and microbiome across a variety of clinical, environmental, and *in vitro* microbiological sample types.

### **Visiting Graduate Researcher** | Wellcome Sanger Institute | Cambridge, England, UK |	Feb 2023 - Mar 2023
Lawley Lab - *Host-Microbiota Interactions*
* Taught untargeted mass spectrometry experimental design, sample preparation, and analysis techniques.

### **Undergraduate Research Assistant** | The Ohio State University | Columbus, OH | Oct 2018 - Jun 2019
Stoodley Lab - *Department of Microbial Infection and Immunology*
* Developed high-throughput methods to quantify biofilm-independent *Staphylococcus aureus* aggregation using 96-well plate imaging and .
* Determined relative contribution of synovial fluid components in cell aggregation within the context of periprosthetic joint infection.	

### **Undergraduate Research Assistant** | The Ohio State University | Columbus, OH | Feb 2017 - Aug 2018
