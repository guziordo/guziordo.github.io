About
======
Welcome! My name is Doug, I'm currently a doctoral candidate within the [Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics](https://mmg.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu/). I am a microbiologist by training, however I am currently developing my skills in large data science, specifically that of metabolomics and microbiome analysis. My current research within the lab of [Robert Quinn](https://www.robertquinnlab.com/) involves investigating the production and physiological consequences of novel bile acid metabolism by our gut microbiome, known as microbial bile acid conjugation (first described by [Quinn et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2047-9) in 2020).

I received my B.S. from the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) in Microbiology. I graduated with research distinction in Microbiology under the advisement of [Dr. Paul Stoodley](https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/non-clinical/microbial-infection-and-immunity/paul-stoodley), where my [undergraduate thesis](https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87372) delved into further understanding the role of synovial fluid components in *Staphylococcus aureus* aggregation.
