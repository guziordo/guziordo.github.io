Welcome! My name is Doug, I'm currently a doctoral candidate within the [Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics](https://mmg.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu/). I am a microbiologist by training, however I am currently developing my skills in large data science, specifically that of metabolomics and microbiome analysis. My current research within the lab of [Robert Quinn](https://www.robertquinnlab.com/) involves investigating the production and physiological consequences of novel bile acid metabolism by our gut microbiome, known as microbial bile acid conjugation (first described by [Quinn et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2047-9) in 2020). 

Current work and research
-----
I use a mix of experiments at the benchtop and computational analysis to further understand the mechanisms behind bile acid conjugation by microbes in our gut. Bile acids are key molecules in nutrient absorption and and cell signalling, although they have also been implicated in gut disbiosis and cancer. Microbially modified bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid, are noteably carcinogenic. However, little is known about microbially conjugated bile acids and my work seeks to uncover the consequences of this novel bile acid transformation. 

My background
------
I received my B.S. from the [Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/) in Microbiology. I graduated with research distinction in Microbiology under the advisement of [Dr. Paul Stoodley](https://medicine.osu.edu/find-faculty/non-clinical/microbial-infection-and-immunity/paul-stoodley), where my [undergraduate thesis](https://kb.osu.edu/handle/1811/87372) delved into further understanding the role of synovial fluid components in *Staphylococcus aureus* aggregation. During my time at Ohio State, I also studied maxillofacial burn wounds in an effort to further understand the *in vitro* processes on going following severe burn injury with Dr. Sashwati Roy and Dr. Nandini Ghosh.

My scientific communities
------
My research touches on a diverse, but related, set of scientific communities. I have experience in the fields of microbial pathogenesis, microbial ecology, and molecular biology in addition to mass spectrometry and protein biochemistry. Within these domains, I rely heavily on computational methods to investigate the significance of, and further contextualize, my work. This breadth of community has resulted in frequent collaborations that resulted frequent publication in high-impact journals.
