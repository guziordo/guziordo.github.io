About
======
Welcome! My name is Doug, I'm currently a doctoral candidate within the [Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics](https://mmg.natsci.msu.edu/) at [Michigan State University](https://www.msu.edu/). I am a microbiologist by training and am currently developing my skills in large data science, specifically that of metabolomics and microbiome analysis. My current research within the lab of [Robert Quinn](https://www.robertquinnlab.com/) involves investigating the production and physiological consequences of novel bile acid metabolism by our gut microbiome.
