When I was a senior in high school, I felt the need to do something drastic. Something to truly close that chapter of my life. I don't think anyone was expecting me to shave my head two months prior to graduation, let alone raise over $1,100 for children's cancer research with (St. Baldrick's Foundation)[https://www.stbaldricks.org/]! A couple years after I started on this path, I managed to convince my younger brother to do the exact same thing. 

We've been shaving our heads with them annually ever since. To date, we've raised over $12,000 together and you can help push that even higher!

Head over to (stbaldricks.org/participants/guzior9)[https://www.stbaldricks.org/participants/guzior9] if you would like to donate, any and all donations are sincerely appreciated!
