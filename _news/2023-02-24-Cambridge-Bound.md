For the first time in my life, I'm traveling internationally, solo! The Quinn Lab has collaborated closely with Trevor Lawley's group at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, and as an extension of that collaboration I am traveling to the Institute for a two week research visit!

My previous work, and in fact the work in the Quinn lab as a whole, is heavily based in untargetted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. I can't wait to exchange knowlege with such a high-profile group and I'm unbelievably excited to see what I can bring back to the lab!
