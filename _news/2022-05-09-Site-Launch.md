Welcome to the initial version of my professional website, chronicalling my journey through my graduate career as I pursue a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics! I will be routinely updating this website to include new publications, posters, and talks. If you have any questions about my work or my experiences, don't be afraid to reach out!
