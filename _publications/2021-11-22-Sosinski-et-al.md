**Abstract**
*Background*
Elexacaftor-Tezacaftor-Ivacaftor (ETI) therapy is showing promising efficacy for treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and is becoming more widely available since recent FDA approval. However, little is known about how these drugs will affect lung infections, which are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among people with CF (pwCF).

*Methods*
We analyzed sputum microbiome and metabolome data from pwCF (n=24) before and after ETI therapy using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics.

*Results*
The sputum microbiome diversity, particularly its evenness, was increased (p=0.036) and the microbiome profiles were different between individuals before and after therapy (PERMANOVA F=1.92, p=0.044). Despite these changes, the microbiomes remained more similar within an individual than across the sampled population. No specific microbial taxa differed in relative abundance before and after therapy, but the collective log-ratio of classic CF pathogens to anaerobes significantly decreased (p=0.013). The sputum metabolome also showed changes associated with ETI (PERMANOVA F=4.22, p=0.002) and was characterized by greater variation across subjects while on treatment. Changes in the metabolome were driven by a decrease in peptides, amino acids, and metabolites from the kynurenine pathway, which were associated with a decrease in CF pathogens. Metabolism of the three small molecules that make up ETI was extensive, including previously uncharacterized structural modifications.

*Conclusions*
ETI therapy is associated with a changing microbiome and metabolome in airway mucus. This effect was stronger on sputum biochemistry, which may reflect changing niche space for microbial residency in lung mucus as the drug's effects take hold.
